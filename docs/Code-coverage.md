# Code Coverage

Testing tools offer developers control over the quality of the products they release. Code coverage is **a testing metric** that can provide reliable information for verifying, scaling, and improving their application over time.

## Metrics
Common metrics include:

* Function coverage: how many of your defined functions have been called
* Statement coverage: the number of statements that have been successfully executed in your program
* Path coverage: how many paths of the control structures in your program (if statements or loops) have been executed
* Condition coverage: how many Boolean expressions have been validated inside your program
* Line coverage: how many lines of your program have been executed

## Best Practice
Best practice is to establish what percentage of coverage is acceptable for your project before releasing any new changes in production.
